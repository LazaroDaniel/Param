About the Param
----

Param is the simplest way to you to stylize your projects, it was made for simple usage and cool design. The initiative to start to create Param came from a quote that I heard, which sounds like "we have to create things that we would like to use". And that's how this project was created.


How Param works?
=====
To use Param it's simple: You just have to call the css file.

	<link href="param.css" rel="stylesheet">

And then you just have to call the classes on the attribute that you want to.
